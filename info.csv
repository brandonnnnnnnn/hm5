567,GI,,"I heard the Keep was once a burial ground for orcs, if you can believe that. Heck, all of Hell’s Throat once belonged to those evil creatures. They say this entire area is sacred to their kind.” (True)
567,GI,,"An earthquake a few months ago shook the land like flour in a sieve. Some folks say it there was some powerful spell behind it. They say it loosed some terrible creature from the rocks — that’s when horses and livestock and such began to mysteriously die off.” (Partly true; there was a minor earthquake, but it had nothing to do with the current leech men killings at the Palisade; see the Hunt for the Leech Men adventure)
567,GI,,"There’s something strange going on out at Karapar Tower, I tell ya. Soldiers are actin’ real queer — hauling equipment up them foot trails, and bein’ real secretive. I’ve heard talk they may have struck silver out there and are keeping it on the lowdown.” (False)
567,GI,,"Only a damn fool would follow the trail up Hell’s Throat to the west. It’s the surest way to get your throat cut and your purse lifted if you ask me. Even the soldiers don’t like going that way.” (True)
567,GI,,"I’ve been hearin’ talk about goblins showin’ up to the south. A couple of trappers passin’ through here the other day had a run in with ‘em. I think the sneaky little bastards are up to something. You can be sure of that.” (True)
567,GI,,"The Keep seems to have an insatiable appetite for armor, weapons, shields and the like. I wish I had the money to haul it in by the cartload.” (True)
567,GI,,"There’s an old hermit what lives in the wood — I heard the strangest claim about him the other day. One of the old captains who came up from P’Bapar claimed he used to be a soldier — right here at the original Keep before them orcs overran it.” (Partly true; the hermit is former Keep Prefect Bandrus, who disappeared without a trace years ago)
567,GI,,"I met a fella the other day who says a merchant’s mules werekilled by wolves out north of Bardamar Tower. They were loaded with goods and silver, so the old coot stashed the stuff in the briars. I wonder if it’s still out there?” (False)
567,GI,,"There’s a helpful ghost out toward the Kar Darkan waystation. He warns travelers about dangers on the road ahead. Aye, it’s true. He crows like a rooster if danger’s coming.” (False)
567,GI,,"The Tanara River? I wouldn’t look into the depths myself, ‘less I wanted to lose my mind. There’s things in those waters that’d make a man’s blood run cold. The ghosts and creatures of darkness lie in those depths, just a’waitin’ – waitin’ for a fool to come by and give ‘em a glance. Then they’ll snatch yer soul, quick as a wink.” (Unknown; may be true in some areas)
567,GI,,"I heard some blood curdling howlin’ coming from the woods last night. Weren’t natural — not like that of a wolf. The gods alone know what lurks out there.” (True)
567,GI,,"At dusk, you can hear the ghost of a jilted lover who leapt over the falls, ‘cause that’s the time the poor chap ended it all. You feel a chill and the hair on your neck start to bristle? It’s his spirit searching the living for his lost love.” (False)
567,GI,,"Dark spirits of dead ghosts and orc gods demand appeasement from travelers on the Hell’s Throat Trail. Appeasing
these spirits requires the gift of silver placed in the hollow of the old tree northwest of the Keep.” (False; local thieves keep this rumor spreading and occasionally check the tree for free coin).
567,GI,,"I hear one of the three dancin’ girls out at the Kar Mandri waystation is gettin’ married to a huge, jealous guard. Best not to trifle with any of them until you find out which one it is.” (False)
567,GI,,"You know Ealon Pifor’s wife, that cripple out at Kar Darkan waystation? A giant spooked her horse, and it threw her. That’s why she’s crippled.” (Partially true; she was thrown from a horse, but no giant was involved)
567,GI,,"One of the sergeants out at Dartan Tower has a reg’lar visit from Dela of the Broken Hilt. I hear she gives him free services, if ’n ya know what I mean. Wink. Wink.” (Partly true – one of the sergeants does dally with Dela, but not at the now decommissioned tower)
567,GI,,"That Rikar keeps some foul beast chained up in the woods, and has it trained to attack anyone snooping out there for the Ravens’ treasure.” (False)
567,GI,,"There are werewolves around here. It’s true! What do you think’s killin’ the horses and livestock at the Palisade?” (Partly true; horses and livestock are being killed, but the leech men are responsible; see the Hunt for the Leech Men adventure)
567,GI,,"If you get locked out of the Keep at night and find the gates are closed — head to the stables. For a few coppers the guards will let you in the compound and you can sleep there.” (True)

567,AI,,"A hunter was in here the other day, and claimed he came across a giant spider the size of a pony out to the west. Thank the gods it was already dead when he found it. Can you imagine? A spider that
size?” (True)
567,AI,,"I saw the remains of some horses, branded with the Keep’s mark, out by the river. They looked like nothing I’ve ever seen got hold of ‘em. They were just ripped apart, and the eyes were bitten out. I tell you, it made me sick.” (Partly true; the Palisade’s horses were killed by the leech men but savaged after death by local predators; see the Hunt for the Leech Men adventure)
567,AI,,"The other day, a fisherman caught somethin’ that wasn’t a fish, but the thing damn near bit his arm off and got away. He told me so himself, bandaged as he was from shoulder to ass. He said he’d never seen anythin’ like it, and whatever it was had a head as big as a wagon wheel.” (Partly true; the fisherman was bandaged,
but from a clumsy fall onto sharp rocks)
567,AI,,"Somethin’s been stalkin’ the Borderland Road. I reckon it’s a rabid wolf from the sounds of the growlin’. Worse, t’other day I heard the sounds of somethin’ being dragged through the brush, hollerin’ the whole way just like a man screamin’ in pain. I hear it’s very large, with red eyes and long fangs - nothin’ to trifle with.” (Partly true; bears and mountain lions do roam the area, but their eyes and teeth are normal.)
567,AI,,"There’s a witch living in the wood to the south. You don’t want to run into her. She’ll put a curse on ya.” (Partly true; there is a witch south of the Keep, but she doesn’t run around cursing people)
567,AI,,"There’s a witch in the southern woods that trades in concoctions, potions and such. Of course, if you actually use one you’ll become her evil servant.” (Partly true; there is a witch, but her goods are safe as those kind of goods get)
567,AI,,"Wolf Tower is haunted. That’s why they never rebuilt it, you know. They say the stones seep blood, and ghosts wail and shriek on moonlit nights.” (False)
567,AI,,"I heard from a fellow that those thieves in Quarrytown hide their treasure in a cave behind the lower falls, but they keep a close watch on who comes and goes there.” (False)
567,AI,,"Eh - Hell’s Throat isn’t as dangerous as people say. I’ve trapped and hunted up there many times. It’s just stories spread by the earl to keep folk from prospectin’ for silver up there.” (False)
567,AI,,"The Padiras River crests in the fall, when it’s at its deadliest. I lost three pack mules to that churning hell.” (True)
567,AI,,"The trout in the Upper Padiras River got fished out. It’s really too bad they’re all gone - they were the tastiest fish ever.” (False)
567,AI,,"If you plan on headin’ to Vew, just make sure you wait and travel with a big caravan. Anyone travelin’ alone is sure be robbed by those Ravens.” (True)
567,AI,,"They say there’s a nest of lizard men along the river to the west. Hell, the falls below the Keep used to be their breedin’ grounds.” (False)
567,AI,,"A couple of prospectors out lookin’ for silver claim they were attacked by kobolds. The damn critters stole everything they had, including the clothes they were wearin’!” (True)
567,AI,,"The land north of the Tanara River has kobold signs all over it.” (True)

567,AI,,"I heard a band of Rikar’s thugs hang out in the woods so the guards can’t find them.” (True)
567,AI,,"Somethin’s not right at Vespin Tower. I heard one of the Ravens say that a couple of soldiers were killed over there not long ago, but the Prefect’s been tryin’ to keep it quiet.” (Party true – some soldiers were killed but the news has not reached the Keep military yet; see Assault on Vespin Tower)
567,AI,,"A couple of fellas murdered one of Rikar’s Ravens and then beat it north into the woods. Maybe they headed for that old mine to hide out.” (True; see the Mercy’s Fortune Mine adventure)
567,AI,,"There’s an old silver mine in the cliffs on the south side of the Tanara River not too far off the path that leads up to Falcon’s Eye Tower. Dwarves used to mine it but they abandoned it when it began to get played out. Too much work getting what little remained they said. An enterprising young feller with a strong back might find himself a bit a loot though if ’n he was willin’ to scratch around a bit." (False; Dasas Zhenshi [the proprietor of Dasas’ Goods detailed in area M10 on page 65 of Frandor’s Keep] periodically scatters around a few trade coins to the local drunks to keep this rumor (and other variants) alive in hopes of selling
mining tools to rubes foolish enough to believe it.)
567,AI,,"A demon totem in our own back yard! Don’t that just beat all. The Prefect had a hissy fit when he heard about that. Had the entire crew of Falcon’s Eye Tower flogged for lettin’ it sit there right under their noses. Good thing he had it torn down – who knows what kind of evil something like that might attract… we got enough problems with these goblin scum." (True - see The Mysterious Shrine.)
567,QI,,"The Toe Hold is a great place to meet the locals, gather information and hire mercenaries.” (False)
567,QI,,"That scoundrel Nyrash is a stinkin’ pile of bloodied skins and gut-soaked boots. He never takes a bath — claims it attracts wolves.” (True)

567,QI,,"Rikar’s woman Vesina is lookin’ to escape his control, and she’ll be glad of any man foolish enough to help her.” (True)
567,QI,,"There’s a crazy dwarf who’s taken to living in Quarrytown recently. Steer clear of that one. He’s 300 pounds of raw temper in a bag of flesh. I hear he kicked in the front door of the Red House one night and threw the poor soul living there into the Brack Water.” (mostly True)
567,QI,,"There used to be a whore named Elva in Quarrytown. She was a good soul. She used to live in the Red House, but disappeared one day. I heard she moved to Vew.” (Partly true; she was actually murdered by Narva; see Q10)
567,QI,,"Goazaar’s an old goat. He’s bedding that young girl, Kylsha (Q15). I see her slip into his shack in the early of the night.” (False; Goazaar occasionally pays her to bring him supplies)

567,QI,,"Shorty the Prophet is a harmless soul, and gentle of spirit even if he is a mite touched in the head. He bears the tattoo of a soldier, and rumor has it he used to be a guard at the old Keep.” (True; see Q3)
567,QI,,"Avoid Harga the blacksmith and spend your money elsewhere. He does shoddy work.” (True; see Q4)

meat… hell, even human meat occasionally.” (False; see Q1)
567,QI,,"You know Vesina? Now there’s a beauty. I heard she’s of high birth, but was kidnapped years ago from her family in P’Bapar and enslaved. Poor thing.” (True; see Q6)
567,QI,,"Ha! That poor drunken sod Narva got tossed out on his ear from his own residence. There’s talk about that one. Some say he’s a wanted man. I’m not sure what he did but he’s lying low for sure.” (Partly true; he’s not wanted yet...; see Q10)
567,QI,,"Bavigo puts sawdust, leaves and worse in his bread to make the flour go further.” (True; see Q20)
567,QI,,"The Earl ran that Goazaar out of the Keep for meddling. Some think the old man is a wizard, but there’s no truth in that. He’s a man of the robes – a worshipper of The Guardian, I think. They say he came to Frandor’s to put an end to the meat-trade. You know — slaves being shipped south to feed the crowd’s bloodlust in
the arenas.” (True; see Q11)
567,QI,,"You know that whore, Larkka? I heard she’s in love with that Larzon Bayz fella and she’s gonna get him to buy her away from the Den of Delights. Unfortunately, her old man heard that too. He gave her a beatin’ within an inch of her life. She can barely walk today. ” (False)
567,QI,,"That crazy fella who talks funny, Mumblin’ Mer? I heard he used to be a guard, but got some bad wine and now he’s missing a few pieces in his brain. Best keep yer eye on him. He’ll rob ya blind, then sell your stuff in the market, big as life.” (Partly true; Jakar Mer is a scrounger, not a robber; see Q1)
567,QI,,"The Brack Water has quite a few corpses in its murky depths. Most are people who crossed Rikar. If someone comes up missin’, it’s likely they’re weighted down in there, bobbing around for all eternity.” (True) 
567,QI,,"Kram Temilon is sick of his wife. He’s talking to Rikar about having her pushed into the Brack Water some night.” (Partly true; Kramidar grumbles but wouldn’t approve of her murder;
see Q1)
567,QI,,"Bavigo sells more than bread at his bakery. I hear he sells a special tea that gives a person funny thoughts, makin’ ‘em feel real good and kinda suggestible. They say he got the recipe from his

567,KI,,"A few weeks ago, some crazy giant was lobbin’ boulders from the mountain heights just above the Keep. Huge stones have been hurled down right inside the Keep walls!! He’s gonna kill somebody one of these days. The gods preserve us.” (True)
567,KI,,"That rascal, Rikar. He poisoned the Keep’s war dogs. I guess that’ll teach the guards for slipping ‘em loose on Quarrytown.” (True)
567,KI,,"A lot of trappers have gone missing recently. Of course, they live a dangerous life, poking about the hinterlands and such...” (True)

567,KI,,"Don’t buy from that elven fletcher. He always marks up the price for humans. He gives better prices and saves the good bows for elves.” (Partly true; he discounts prices for elves, but will sell his best bows to anyone)

567,LI,,"That Rikar is a sly one — he’s got a target on his back and knows it. He doesn’t trust anyone. In fact, he pays some damn fool Raven who looks like him to walk about Quarrytown in the evening and draw out any would-be assassins. Now there’s a job I wouldn’t want.” (True)
567,LI,,"There’s a snot-nosed kid workin’ for Rikar, lurin’ poor souls into his clutches in the woods and lookin’ all innocent later. I hear it’s not really a boy at all, just a little girl in disguise.” (True;
